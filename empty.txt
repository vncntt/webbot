Question 1: Match each auditory reception structure to its characteristics, below. The options are: Cochlea, Pinna, Tympanic Membrane, Oval Window, Ossicles

Snail-like coiled chamber housing auditory receptor cells
Also called "eardrum"
Question 2: HINT: Read through entire paragraph before responding!
In the central chamber (Scala Media) of the cochlea lies the [Zonules of Zinn, Organ of Corti, Nodes of Ranvier] - the location at which sound is transduced into neurological signals. The floor of this structure is called the [Basilar Membrane, Tympanic Membrane, Tectorial Membrane] while the ceiling is called the [Basilar membrane, Tympanic Membrane, Tectorial Membrane]. The auditory receptor cells, called [A1 cells, Hair Cells, Spiral Gaglions], stand between these two membranes. When the vibrating ossicles press on the membrane called the [Round Window, Oval Window], this sets up a vibration in the [Cochlear Fluid, CSF] that fills the cochlea. As that vibration moves through the cochlea, from Base to Apex and back, the [Tectorial Membrane, Basilar Membrane, Tympanic Membrane] moves up when the [Tectorial Membrane, Basilar Membrane, Tympanic Membrane] moves down, bending the [Axons, Cillia] of the receptor cells in between. This deformation of the [Hair Cells, Cochlear Nucleus Cells, Spiral Ganglions] causes [K+, Ca++, Na+, Cl-] to flow into those cells, which [Increases, Decreases] the polarity of that cell. Ultimately, this causes [K+, Ca++, Na+, Cl-] to enter, and, as a result, [Cochlear Fluid, Neurotransmitter, Neurotrophin] is released, in [an Action Potential, a Graded Potential].
Question 3: Indicate whether the following are TRUE or FALSE in regards to Place Coding for frequency in audition.
A) Place coding depends on the physical structure of the Basilar Membrane [True, False]
B) The apex end of the membrane is narrow and stiff [True, False]
C) The beginning of the membrane, near the Oval Window, is wide and floppy [True, False]
D) Because of its structure, different places along the membrane resonate to different frequencies [True, False]
E) A given frequency will produce the highest level of NT release at the most resonating place along the membrane, with slightly less at adjacent places, and less & less the farther from the place of maximum resonance [True, False]
F) Your nervous system only records the place of maximum resonance, to code for that frequency [True, False]
Question 4: Indicate whether the following are TRUE or FALSE of Temporal (Rate) Coding for frequency in audition.
A) Rate coding depends on the physical structure of the Tectorial Membrane [True, False]
B) The entire active membrane tends to oscillate at the same rate as the incoming frequency [True, False]
C) Even though some places along the membrane release more NT than others, whatever Hair Cells do fire, fire at the same rate [True, False]
D) Hair Cells fire Action Potentials, and so their rate of firing is limited by their Refractory Period [True, False]
E) The Spiral Ganglions overcome this Refractory Period limitation by taking turns, together producing an output along the Auditory Nerve that matches the incoming frequency [True, False]
F) The "Volley Principle" argues that only if the ganglions are "phase locked" will they produce volleys of activity at a rate that matches the incoming frequency [True, False]


Question 5: Localization makes use of the differences in a sound reaching the two ears. Match each type of difference with its localization functions below. Options are: Intensity Differences, Phase Differences, Timing Differences
Via "Inter-Aural Time-Disparity Detectors"
Works best for higher frequencies
Concerns which ear is in the "head shadow"
Works best for lower frequencies, but only in large-headed listeners
Involves a race between "Onset" cells from the cochlear nucleus
Concerns which ear is pressured by the condensation, and which by rarefaction of air molecules

Question 6: Match the structure in the Monaural Auditory Pathway to its characteristics, below. Options are: Spiral Ganglions, Cochlear Nucleus, Outer Hair Cells, Inner Hair Cells
Divergent connectivity, preserving details
Axons form auditory portion of the 8th Cranial Nerve

Convergent connectivity, more like visual Rods than Cones
Each side sends an "Onset" signal, in a race to the Superior Olive

Question 7: Match the structure in the Binaural Auditory Pathway to its characteristics, below. Options are: Medial Geniculate Nucleus (MGN), Superior Olive, A2, A1, Inferior Colliculus, Wernicke's Area
Midbrain structure that maps & tracks sound sources
Primary Projection Area in the cortex for auditory information
First binaural site; e.g. Compare arrival times of "onset" signals from the two Cochlear Nuclei
Thalamic area that projects to Temporal Cortex
Higher auditory cortex, specialized for recognizing speech sounds
Cells in this area of auditory cortex respond more strongly to a changing, than a single, frequency

Question 8: The following are auditory-system examples of what fundamental principle?
In Place Coding, frequency in the Cochlea is coded as the relative volume of NT released, along a length of the Basilar Membrane.
In Temporal ("Rate") Coding, frequency in the Cochlea is coded as the rate at which pulses of NT are released, along the entire active Basilar Membrane.
As in the Volley Principle, while no Spiral Ganglion can, on its own, reproduce a 3kHz rhythm of NT release, a group of these cells, working in concert, can.
Options:
"Cells that Fire Together, Wire Together"
"Across Fiber Coding"
