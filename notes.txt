- doesn't work on practice hws because the html file is slightly different


workflow:
run script which takes the quiz url as an argument ->
opens up a new folder with the quiz number -> 
clicks "take the quiz" button -> 
saves the page source to quiz_num_source.html ->
clicks "submit answers" button (first submission will just be to get the page source and not for any answers)->
run parse_html.py on the page source to get the quiz structure and saves it to a json file in the folder->
run the current main.py on the quiz_num_source.html to get the answers and saves it to quiz_num_answers.txt ->
after all the answers are stored, run submit_answers.py to submit all the answers
